integration tests
===

! what?

take eample in real life to think about:

car breaks down.

- what the problem is?
- how to fix it?

u should think of the car's movement as the ultimate integration test of all parts.
if the test fials, all the parts fail together;
if it succeeds, the parts all succeed.

NOTE << The Complete Guide to Software Testing >>

definition: 
an orderly progression of testing in which software and/or hardware elements are combined and tested until the entire
system has been integrated.

or 
Integration testing means testing two or more dependent software modules as a group. 

! how?

To summarize: an integration test exercises many units of code that
work together to evaluate one or more expected results from the software, 
whereas a unit test usually exercises and tests only a single unit in isolation.

! why?

Drawbacks of integration tests compared to automated unit tests

❂ Can I run and get results from the test I wrote two weeks or months or years ago?

❂ Can any member of my team run and get the results from tests I wrote two months ago?

❂ Can I run all the tests in no more than a few minutes?

❂ Can I run all the tests at the push of a button?

❂ Can I write a basic test in no more than a few minutes?
