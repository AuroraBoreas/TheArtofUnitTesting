concept: TDD
test-driven development

Once we know how to write structured, maintainable, and solid tests
with a unit-testing framework, the next question is when to write the
tests. 

Many people feel that the best time to write unit tests 
for software is after the software has been written, 
but a growing number of people prefer writing unit tests before the production code is written.
This approach is called test-first or test-driven development (TDD).

? Refactoring 

refactoring means changing a piece of code without changing its functionality. 

If you’ve ever renamed a method, you’ve done refactoring. 

If you’ve ever split a large method into multiple smaller method calls, 
you’ve refactored your code. 

The code still does the same thing, but it
becomes easier to maintain, read, debug, and change.
