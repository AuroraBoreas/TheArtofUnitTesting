! what is a good unit test?

P37

A unit test is an automated piece of code that invokes the method or
class being tested and then checks some assumptions about the logical
behavior of that method or class. A unit test is almost always written
using a unit-testing framework. It can be written easily and runs
quickly. It’s fully automated, trustworthy, readable, and maintainable. 


properties of a good unit test

- it should be automated and repeatable
- it should be easy to implemented
- once it's written, it should remain for future use
- anyone should be able to run it
- it should run at the push of a button
- it should run quickly

! why?
to start off, ask yourself the following questions.

❂ Can I run and get results from a unit test I wrote two weeks or
months or years ago?

❂ Can any member of my team run and get the results from unit tests I
wrote two months ago?

❂ Can I run all the unit tests I’ve written in no more than a few minutes?

❂ Can I run all the unit tests I’ve written at the push of a button?

❂ Can I write a basic unit test in no more than a few minutes?
