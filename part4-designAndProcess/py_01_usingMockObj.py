? concept: interaction testing?
put two or more units together, let em interact with each other,
check outcome is what we expect. 

? understanding Mock obj
A mock object is a fake object in the system that decides whether the
unit test has passed or failed. 

It does so by verifying whether the object
under test interacted as expected with the fake object. Thereâ€™s usually
no more than one mock per test.

? difference btwn mock and stub?

When using a stub, the assert is performed on the class under test. 
The stub aids in making sure the test runs smoothly.
